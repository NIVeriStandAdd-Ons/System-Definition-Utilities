VeriStand Addon System Definition Utilities
===================

The VeriStand Addon System Definition Utilities makes creating an addon's system definition API simpler and significantly more efficient.  It also works in LabVIEW and TestStand (which is not true of the shipping VeriStand functions).  It also allows for easier importing and exporting of your addon.

### Usage ###
Install the VI package in the Built folder.

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2016

### Built Availability ###

Use the attached VI Package in the Built folder.

### Quality, Limitations ###

The IP is new and is not in wide use yet. The API is using CDS structures with OFFLINE==TRUE and OFFLINE==FALSE(Default) options for the VI implementations that use VeriStand .NET API  => the lack of CDS structures with these options might cause compile errors when building Engine libraries for Custom Devices for RT Targets.

OFFLINE==TRUE - marks code to be executed outside the context of VeriStand, for example an API in a normal LabVIEW project.
OFFLINE==FALSE(Default) - marks code that can be executed within the context of VeriStand.

The reason is that due to cross-referencing, the Advanced System Definition API library and some of it's member VIs might included in the Engine builds for the RT targes, and this will lead to errors during builds ( since .NET controls used in this library are not supported on RT Targets).

The Changes were made using LV2017
